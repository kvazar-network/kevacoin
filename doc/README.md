Kevacoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Kevacoin Core is the original Kevacoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Kevacoin transactions (which is currently more than 7 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Kevacoin Core, visit [kevacoin.org](https://kevacoin.org).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Kevacoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/kevacoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/kevacoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run kevacoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Kevacoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Kevacoin-Core.
